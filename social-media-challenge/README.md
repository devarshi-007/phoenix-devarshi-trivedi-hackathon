# Social media dashboard with theme switcher

![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Deploying your project

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
